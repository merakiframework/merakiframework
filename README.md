# Meraki

> Not a framework!

## What does Meraki mean? 

Meraki means to 'do something with soul, love or creativity; to put something of yourself into your work.'

## What is Meraki? 

Meraki (despite the name of the organisation) is not a framework, but instead a set of compartmentalised 
components to be consumed by libraries, frameworks and individuals. It aims to follow RFC standards as close as possible 
while also incorporating the definitions/terminology into the actual components 
themselves (classes, interfaces, methods, etc. ) By using this approach, developers now have the benefit of understanding
how everything works just by looking at the names of the classes and methods.

In addition, Meraki aims to keep complexity to an absolute minimum. Components should be easy to use and provide a solid
foundation for other software. 

## How are the components versioned?

This project follows semver semantics with one addition: a major number corresponds to a set of documents within an RFC standard.
